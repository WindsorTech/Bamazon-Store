# Welcome to Bamazon!
## Here you will find the best products for the lowest prices and fastest delivery!

### The app is working seamlessly! When run, it displays all the items in the Bamazon inventory table, as well as the products' IDs and prices.

### It prompts the user to enter the desired product ID, and also asks how many items of the product he wants to purchase.

### If the quantity entered by the user is not in stock, the app displays: Insufficient Quantity!

### After that, the app shows a sale summary stating the Product Name, Price, Quantity and Grand Total.

### Finally, the app asks for a confirmation from the user. Once this is done, a Thank You message is displayed and the SQL database is updated!
